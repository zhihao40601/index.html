        <h4>1.Extending the Models for Spatio-temporal Data Prediction</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="par2-container">
        <p>Massive data become easily accessible due to recent open data 
            movements. A large portion of them involve geographical locations.
            Spatial statistics was the typical method for such kind of data,
            but it becomes infeasible for the exploding volumes of data. 
            But the existing methods are limited by their complexity, 
            making it difficult to handle the ever-increasing volume of data being collected. 
            Our recent focus of research has been on finding ways to enhance computational efficiency 
            while maintaining the flexibility of the model. We have been engaged 
            in at least the following related areas.</p>

            <div class="par3-container">
                <p>PM2.5 pollution is harmful to human health, and the air quality monitoring stations managed by the 
                    Environmental Protection Agency provide high-quality measurements. However, the stations are expensive 
                    to establish and sparsely distributed, with only 77 monitoring stations in Taiwan. In contrast, the recent 
                    airbox monitoring network consists of thousands of low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) sensing devices, 
                    offering advantages in terms of spatial coverage. Airbox data is often complex and of unstable quality, 
                    which has motivated us in at least the following aspects.</p>
